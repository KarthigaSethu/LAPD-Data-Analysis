### Summary
In this project, we take on the role of data scientists whose mission involves collaborating closely with the Los Angeles Police
Department (LAPD) to provide comprehensive insights aimed at enhancing their operational
effectiveness. One of our goals is to investigate existing patrol boundaries; with the intention of
establishing more intuitive ones, thereby improving the crime forecasting across a wide range of new
“hotspot” areas. Additionally, our analysis involves assessing the safety of hourly time frames to
better understand patterns and trends that emerge, with recommendations to hopefully strengthen
efficient resource allocation. We also plan to delve into the dynamics of crime report responsiveness
across various factors. The incentive of this report is two-pronged; to educate citizens on the importance of
being attentive and reporting crimes that happen, and to inform police investigations for cases that
might “fall between the cracks”. Furthermore, our objective includes empowering the LAPD with a
daily anomaly detection tool, enabling proactive measures against irregularities in crime data and a
monthly short-term forecasting to uncover the crime trend activity. Finally we conduct a deep-dive on
victim demographics, to better understand what sort of individuals are most often targeted, with the
intent of suggesting mitigation strategies.
